The RESTful API for a Library Management System is built using Node.js** and Express.js in Visual Studio Code (VS Code) to effectively manage a libraryâ€™s book inventory through CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. This API allows users to retrieve all books ('GET /books'), get specific books by ID ('GET /books/:id'), add new books ('POST /books'), update existing books ('PUT /books/:id'), and delete books ('DELETE /books/:id'). The project starts by initializing a Node.js environment with 'npm init -y' and installing necessary dependencies like Express.js, CORS, and Nodemon for handling requests, managing cross-origin access, and enabling live server reloading. For simplicity, data is stored in-memory, but the API can be easily connected to a database like MongoDB or MySQL. Proper error handling ensures that invalid requests return suitable HTTP responses such as 400 Bad Request or 404 Not Found. The API operates on port 5000 and can be tested using Postman or Thunder Client in VS Code. Designed to streamline book management, this API is perfect for libraries, bookstores, or digital cataloging systems, offering a scalable backend solution. It adheres to best development practices, ensuring modularity, maintainability, and security. Additionally, it serves as a valuable learning resource for developers to grasp RESTful API design, middleware usage, request handling, and full-stack integration with front-end technologies like React, Angular, or Vue.js. This API can also be deployed on cloud platforms such as*Heroku, AWS, or DigitalOcean, making it suitable for real-world applications. Overall, this project simplifies library inventory management, enhances data transactions, and provides a strong foundation for backend development in JavaScript, Node.js, and Express.js.
